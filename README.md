## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Made use of the <a href="https://scrollrevealjs.org/" target="_blank">ScrollRevealJS library<a/> and <a href="https://swiperjs.com/" target="_blank">Swiperjs library<a/>to implement the 
animations of the sections and the slider. 


## Optimizations

In the future i may make this with a multipage approach and design a backend to allow users to create account.

## Lessons Learned:

* Mobile first approach
* Mobile menu
* BEM and code organization
* Mobile navigation animations
* Newsletter made with Convertkit to capture user email
