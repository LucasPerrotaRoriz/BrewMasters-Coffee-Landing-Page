# My Awesome Project
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

In the future i may include dark mode and a more descriptive card for the products

## Lessons Learned:

In this project i learned how to create a website with a mobile first approach. I learned how to properly organize my code and name things using a BEM pattern.
